# Each-A-Sketch 

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">TOP Fundamentals Course</a>

Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">this article</a> if you need more info on what Etch-A-Sketch is.

### How it works

* On load, a ```16x16``` grid of square ```div```s is created
* On right-side panel, you can choose between several options
* If clicked on ```clear surface```, ```confirm``` prompt will appear
* If clicked on ```generate grid```, you will be prompted to enter a value between ```1-100```
* Using a value entered in prompt, a new grid with that value is created (e.g. ```100``` creates a ```100x100``` grid)

Hope you enjoy playing :+1:
