Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">this article</a> if you need more info on what Etch-A-Sketch is.

### How it works
```
On load, a 16x16 grid of square divs is created
On right-side panel, you can choose between several options
If clicked on "clear surface", prompt will come up to confirm
If clicked on 'generate grid', you will be prompted to enter a value between 1-100, which will generally create a new grid with a value entered in the prompt (e.g. 100 creates a 100x100 grid)
```

Hope you enjoy playing :+1:
